**The Yittrium Network**
Welcome to the Yittrium Network, your gateway to an unblocked digital experience at school!

*Proxies*: Servers that mask your IP address and allow access to blocked websites.
*VPNs*: Secure connections that encrypt your internet traffic and provide anonymity.
*Guides and tutorials*: Easy-to-follow instructions for setting up and using the provided tools.
*Troubleshooting*: Answers to common problems and assistance with specific issues.
